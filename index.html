    <p>
      Hello, I'm Naveen Mendola. I grew up in a small village in the mountains of Uttarakhand.
      During my Master's studies, I began exploring coupled oscillators and nonlinear dynamics
      as a structured subject, and it immediately captured my interest. My first research
      project focused on chimera states in Dr. Sarika Jalan's lab, which later became the core
      of my Master's thesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was fortunate to work alongside amazing labmates, seniors, and mentors during this
      period. The collaborative environment, and how the group discussed recent research and their work
      further deepened my curiosity and inspired me to learn more tools and theory along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, I joined Dr. Thounaojam at Bennett University for my PhD. He encouraged me to
      actively engage with the recent research in the field and to experiment freely using
      my programming skills. Through his guidance, I began working on ideas that intrigued
      me right away, many of which I might not have pursued otherwise. I could write some of them 
      here in <a href="mywork.html#otherprojects">other projects</a>. Please have a look.
    </p>
